## Features

- **High-performance by default** — Get rocket-fast builds with generous CPU and memory limits — no tuning needed.
- **Fair, load-based billing** — Every second, we track each job’s CPU and memory load. Only pay for load, idle CPU is free.
- **Seamless integration** — Plug into your existing setup in minutes — no vendor lock-in, no headaches.

---

## How it Works

- Each CI job starts inside its own **Spike Instance** — a lightweight MicroVM that delivers raw CPU performance and complete tenant isolation.  
- Every second we meter the job’s actual CPU and memory load, so you pay only for the resources the job really uses, not for pre-allocated capacity that sits idle.  
- Because runners are completely ephemeral, your pipelines stay fast, secure, and self-cleaning.
